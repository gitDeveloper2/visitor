very good. now to the verification logic. even for the admin one and cron. the given url for verification must be a child of the submited appurl. also include other checks so that a user doesnt just submit ay link. we want a good do follow link for seo, we are just hiding behind teh word "verification". so its do follow, in the same website so they dont submit random sites,a nd other checks too. i was also thinking tha tto avoid being tracked by seo craelers for the same link and achor text we should find a way  to make sthi stuff abit differnt. one such way for the url is tha tit should link to their app detail page not the main homepage. but the anchor text and otherstuff arent clea to me. help
