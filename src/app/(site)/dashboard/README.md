# Dashboard Structure Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the organized dashboard structure for BasicUtils, providing a clear separation between user and admin functionality.

## Directory Structure

│   ├── app/                   # App submission forms and logic
│   └── blog/                  # Blog submission forms and logic
├── my-apps/                   # User's app management
├── my-blogs/                  # User's blog management
└── admin/                     # All admin functionality

## Migration Notes

### Completed Migrations
- ✅ Moved submission functionality to `/submit/`
- ✅ Renamed `badge-management/` to `badges/`
- ✅ Created legacy structure for old admin features
- ✅ Organized admin features into logical groups

### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Update navigation components to reflect new structure
- [ ] Update route guards and permissions
- [ ] Migrate legacy features to new structure
- [ ] Update API endpoints to match new structure
- [ ] Update breadcrumbs and navigation links

## File Organization Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for directory names
- Use PascalCase for component files
- Use camelCase for utility files
- Use descriptive names that indicate functionality

### Component Structure
Each directory should contain:
- `page.tsx` - Main page component
- `layout.tsx` - Layout component (if needed)
- `components/` - Directory-specific components
- `utils/` - Directory-specific utilities
- `types/` - Directory-specific TypeScript types

### Import Paths
Use absolute imports from the project root:
```typescript
import { Component } from '@/components/Component'
import { utility } from '@/utils/utility'
import { type } from '@/types/type'
```

## Security Considerations

### Route Protection
- All dashboard routes should be protected
- Admin routes require admin privileges
- User routes require authentication
- Implement proper role-based access control

### Data Validation
- Validate all form inputs
- Sanitize user data
- Implement CSRF protection
- Use proper authentication tokens

## Performance Considerations

### Code Splitting
- Implement lazy loading for admin features
- Split legacy features into separate chunks
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components

### Caching
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use Next.js built-in caching features
- Optimize database queries

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
- [ ] Implement real-time notifications
- [ ] Add advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive admin interface
- [ ] Add bulk operations for admin features
- [ ] Implement audit logging

### Legacy Migration
- [ ] Gradually migrate legacy features
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] Document migration process
- [ ] Create migration scripts
