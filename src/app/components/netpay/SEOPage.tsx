        Understanding your net pay is important for financial planning. Net pay refers to the money you take home after all 
        deductions from your gross income have been made. Example deductions include taxes, social security contributions, and 
        other statutory charges. In Kenya, these calculations can be complicated given the regular changes in tax brackets and 
        deduction rates. It includes many elements such as PAYE (Pay As You Earn), NSSF (National Social Security Fund), SHIF 
        (Social Health Insurance Fund), and housing levies all determining the final amount.

    <Typography paragraph>
        Our net pay calculator simplifies the process. It suits both employee and employer providing accurate payroll information. 
        This will save you time and effort.

        In this post, we'll look at how a net pay calculator works, and why it's a useful tool for anyone trying to manage their money.

    <Typography paragraph>
        Net pay is the amount of money that an employee takes home after all mandatory deductions have been made. It shows real earnings that can be spent or saved. It can also be viewed as the actual income that will be paid into your account.
    </Typography>

    <Typography paragraph>
        In Kenya, most deductions are done from an employee's paycheck before they are paid. These deductions are required by law. They include:

    <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>The Importance of Accurate Net Pay Calculation</Typography>

    <Typography paragraph>
        Accurate net pay calculation is important for financial planning. It assists employees to budget more effectively. This way, they can create realistic financial objectives. These include saving for emergencies, investments, or significant expenditures. It is considerably more difficult to regulate spending habits or prevent unneeded debt when you don't know how much money you have.
    </Typography>

    <Typography paragraph>
        Furthermore, incorrect net pay computations can lead to considerable financial mistakes. Overestimates discourage employees from using their money, while underestimates encourage employees to overspend. None of those are good. Inaccurate estimates might also lead to salary disputes between the employer and the employee.
    </Typography>

    <Typography paragraph>
        Our net pay calculator gives employees the power to understand their net pay, thus avoiding such issues.
    </Typography>

        To put it simply, an accurate net pay calculation is more than just figures; it's also about making informed financial decisions and safeguarding your employee rights.

<section id="common-mistakes">
    <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>Common Mistakes in Net Pay Calculations</Typography>

    <Typography paragraph>
        Manually calculating net pay can be error-prone. Here are some frequent problems people make when doing manual calculations, and how the Kenya Net Pay Calculator eliminates them.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h3" gutterBottom>1. Misapplication of Tax Rates</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
        A common error is failing to apply the correct rate to each portion of the total salary. For example, applying a flat rate to the entire salary rather than graded rates.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h3" gutterBottom>2. Not Accounting for All Mandatory Deductions</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
        Several statutory deductions, such as PAYE, NSSF, SHIF, and the housing levy, must be subtracted. Failing to subtract even one of them will give incorrect tax results.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="h3" gutterBottom>3. Missing Out on Allowances or Benefits</Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
        Many employees qualify for allowances. These include transportation or housing benefits. Failure to include these in tax calculations leads to an undervalued net pay estimate.
