      {/* Section: What is it */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        What Is the Elevation Finder?
      </Typography>

      <Typography paragraph>
        It is a responsive, user-friendly web application that provides real-time
        elevation information from anywhere in the world. Built on top of a highly interactive{' '}
        <strong>Elevation Map</strong>, the tool allows you to select or input locations in multiple formats and
        instantly get the terrain elevation, along with rich, contextual details about the area.
      </Typography>

      <Typography paragraph>
        No matter where you are or what you’re planning, the <strong>Elevation Finder</strong> equips you with a
        high-precision tool that responds quickly and beautifully to your commands.
      </Typography>

      {/* Section: How It Works */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        How the Elevation Finder Works
      </Typography>

      <Typography paragraph>
        At its core, the tool is designed for flexibility and simplicity. The tool offers{' '}
        <strong>three unique methods</strong> of input to retrieve elevation data:
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h3" gutterBottom>
        1. Click Anywhere on the Map
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        With the embedded world <strong>Elevation Map</strong>, you can simply click any location. Instantly, the{' '}
        <strong>Elevation Finder</strong> loads the height data for that point. Whether it’s the Andes, the Alps, or
        your hometown, clicking any spot brings up its elevation and adds it to your session history.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h3" gutterBottom>
        2. Enter Coordinates in Latitude and Longitude
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        If you already know the exact coordinates, you can enter them directly using standard latitude and longitude
        format. The <strong>Elevation Finder</strong> will automatically zoom to that point on the{' '}
        <strong>Elevation Map</strong>, display its height, and include the result in your list of queried points.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h3" gutterBottom>
        3. Enter a Single Coordinate String
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        For power users or those using GPS-derived input, a single-line coordinate string is also accepted. The{' '}
        <strong>Elevation Finder</strong> intelligently parses the input, retrieves the elevation, and places a marker
        on the <strong>Elevation Map</strong>, offering the same complete experience.
      </Typography>

      {/* Section: Area Context */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        Enhanced Area Context
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        What truly sets the <strong>Elevation Finder</strong> apart from a simple <strong>Elevation Map</strong> is its
        ability to provide <strong>location context</strong>. Beyond just the number showing the elevation, the tool
        returns helpful descriptions of the area, such as the nearest town, locality, or geographic feature. This makes
        the tool perfect for travel planning, research, or educational use.
      </Typography>

      {/* Section: Sidebar */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        Live Feedback with an Interactive Sidebar
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Every time you interact with the <strong>Elevation Finder</strong>, your actions are reflected on a beautifully
        designed sidebar. This sidebar lists every coordinate you’ve clicked or entered, along with:
      </Typography>

      <ul>
        <li>The elevation in meters</li>
        <li>The general location name</li>
        <li>A small reference pin color-coded by order</li>
      </ul>

      <Typography paragraph>
        You can use this list to track multiple locations at once, making comparisons easy and organized.
      </Typography>

      {/* Section: Clear Button */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        Clear All Functionality
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Sometimes you want to start fresh. The <strong>Elevation Finder</strong> includes a simple "Clear All" button
        that wipes all your pins, data, and sidebar entries with one click. This gives you a clean slate to explore
        other areas without any visual clutter on your <strong>Elevation Map</strong>.
      </Typography>

      {/* Section: Rate Limiting */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        Intelligent Request Limiting
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        To protect both performance and the user experience, the <strong>Elevation Finder</strong> includes built-in{' '}
        <strong>rate limiting</strong> features. If you're clicking too many locations too quickly, the system politely
        slows down to avoid overload. This isn’t just about server health—it’s about maintaining the smooth and
        responsive interaction that defines the <strong>Elevation Map</strong> experience.
      </Typography>

      {/* Section: Fly-to */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        Fly-to Animation on Coordinate Entry
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Another user-loved feature of the <strong>Elevation Finder</strong> is its elegant fly-to animation. When you
        enter a coordinate, the <strong>Elevation Map</strong> doesn’t just load the point—it{' '}
        <strong>flies you there</strong> with a smooth transition.
      </Typography>

      {/* Section: Design */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        Built with Beauty and Usability in Mind
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Unlike many technical tools that favor function over form, the <strong>Elevation Finder</strong> is thoughtfully
        designed using modern UI frameworks like MUI. The interface is clean, responsive, and optimized for clarity and
        aesthetics.
      </Typography>

      <ul>
        <li>Interactive pins on the <strong>Elevation Map</strong></li>
        <li>Tooltips that show elevation info on hover</li>
        <li>Dark mode compatibility</li>
        <li>Smooth transitions and real-time data updates</li>
      </ul>

      {/* Section: Use Cases */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        Who Is the Elevation Finder For?
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        The tool is useful for a wide range of users, including:
      </Typography>

      <ul>
        <li>Hikers and adventurers checking terrain</li>
        <li>Students and educators teaching geography</li>
        <li>Web developers needing elevation lookups</li>
        <li>Urban planners and architects</li>
        <li>Curious minds exploring Earth’s features</li>
      </ul>

      {/* Section: Comparison */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        Why Use an Elevation Finder Instead of Other Mapping Tools?
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        While popular map platforms may show terrain lines or relative elevations, they often lack the ability to{' '}
        <strong>quickly return numeric elevation values</strong> or let you easily explore multiple points. The{' '}
        tool is different. It's specialized, lightweight, and tailored specifically to the
        task of elevation lookup across the globe.
      </Typography>

      {/* Section: Closing */}
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>

        <strong>Elevation Map</strong> can be.
