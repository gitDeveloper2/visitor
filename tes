I updated /launch to be launch-date aware:
“Premium Launches Today” and “Today’s Launches” sections are pulled from /api/launch/today (based on launchDate).
Each card now shows a “Launch: MMM d” chip if it has launchDate.
Listings use external batch vote counts to display current votes on visible apps.
I added date selection and booking in the submission form; premium overrides full days.
Next, I’ll add launch-awareness to dashboard:
In /dashboard/my-apps: show each app’s scheduled launch date if any; allow rescheduling/cancel.
In admin: a view to set daily caps, see bookings, and reschedule.
Say “go” and I’ll wire those in now.
